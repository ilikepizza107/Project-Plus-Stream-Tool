This is a description about what each scene (.html file) does. All of these scenes need "Shutdown source when not visible" and "Refresh browser when scene becomes active" checked in the OBS properties.

Keep in mind that every single scene is controlled simply by the .exe, and that you can use the Remote GUI to update the stream from afar. Read the Remote GUI section here for more info on setup: https://plusside.net/articles/Project+-Stream-Tool.html
